*** About Rawstudio ***

Rawstudio is an open-source program to read and manipulate RAW images from 
digital cameras.

To get the best quality out of your digital camera, it is often recommended
that you record your pictures in RAW format. This format is mostly specific
to a camera and cannot be read by most image editing applications. 
Our goal is to supply you with a tool, where you can have the benefits of 
RAW images and the ease of use of JPEG images.

The main focus of Rawstudio is to enable efficient review and fast processing 
of large image collections. We aim to supply you with a tool that makes it
possible for you to review and process several hundred images
in a matter of a few hours.

Rawstudio will convert your RAW files into JPEG, PNG or TIF images which you
can then print or send to friends and clients. You can also upload photos 
directly to Picasa, Flickr and Facebook galleries.

Rawstudio is intended as the first tool in your image processing chain. 
After you have made your overall image adjustments to your image, you can 
use an image editing application to further work on your images. 
Rawstudio itself is a highly specialized application for reviewing and 
processing RAW images, not a fully featured image editing application.
