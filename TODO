- native raw loader for CR2 and NEF
- artwork (icon and logo)
- crop
- lightsout-mode

- save tab A,B & C (selectable) as Layered TIFF
- ability to select more than one thumbnail in iconbar (priority, paste, batch convert ...)

General TODO
------------

Interpolation
 For example sinc, AVG or just anything that can handle bayer grids.

Misc
 Check (and correct if possible) GNOME HIG-compliance.

Misc features
 Crop
 Levels
 Batch processing - maybe in gtk's idle loop.

Artwork
 We need logo and icon.

Documentation
 We need some online documentation - and a tutorial.
 We need inline developer documentation (Doxygen?).
 Maybe someone could do a screencast of Rawstudio in action.

Loaders
 It would be nice to have native loaders for RAW files, for starters just cr2.
 EXIF should be supported.
