-------
Rawstudio is an open source project. Everybody is welcome to participate. Feel
free to look at the TODO or just scratch your own itch. We welcome patches.

Overview
-----------------
Rawstudio is build upon a few RS_*-typedef's. All lowlevel handling of these
is placed in rawstudio.c.

typedef RS_IMAGE16
Image data in 16 bit unsigned. In the future this may change to 16 bit SIGNED.

Structure members:
gushort *pixels: Interleaved pixeldata, channels * 2 bytes/pixel
gint w: Width in pixels
gint h: Height in pixels
gint channels: Number of channels. Must be 3 or 4.
gint pitch: The distance in pixels from the beginning of line n to line n+1.
rowstride: The distance in BYTES from the beginning of line n to line n+1.

typedef RS_IMAGE8
This is much like RS_IMAGE16, but with 8 bit pixeldata. Only difference is
pixels.

guchar *pixels: Interleaved pixeldata, channels * 1 byte/pixel

Please try to code in the same style as the rest of Rawstudio.

Tabwidth is 4, spaces is never used for alignment.
